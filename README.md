This includes both server and client of the app. Previously deployed on heroku, it worked with very slow speed. However, decided to put down as there is lot of glitches with the app.

If want to try out, you need Database, Mongodb. 


Run
```
npm install
```
on both client and main directory.

Then, run
```
npm start
```
on both main and client directory. Client will be react front-end, the main directory will run server, backend.

It takes around 15~20 seconds to load the data from Mongodb Atlas to local. Thus, make sure you wait, otherwise conflicts will incur.
